	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science and algorithms. It refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run in relation to the size of its input data. An efficient algorithm is one that has a low time complexity, meaning it can handle larger inputs without significantly increasing the time it takes to produce a result. Efficient algorithms are essential in optimizing software and ensuring that it performs well, even with large datasets.</p>
    
    <p>Space Complexity is another critical aspect of algorithm analysis. It pertains to the amount of memory or space an algorithm requires to execute its tasks. One common way to express space complexity is using the big O notation, often denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. The use of O(n) helps us understand how the space requirements of an algorithm grow as the input size increases. <b>Space Complexity</b> is essential to manage memory usage efficiently, especially in resource-constrained environments.</p>
